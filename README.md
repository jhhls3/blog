           Who doesn't listen to music. Music is a everyday occurrence. Whether people are performing daily tasks or working music helps pass the time. Music releases endorphins into the brain. Causing their emotions to change either by motivation, sparking friendship, or just falling in love.
            </p>
            <p> Creating music is a lengthy process to craft the right piece. From composing the correct instruments and choosing the correct musicians to play them. This can be a lengthy process, but the effort is worth it in the end. Musicians take pride in their accomplishments hearing how people praise their work. For what our favorite shows, video games, or movies be without their composed pieces to their scenes. Would the titanic sinking be more impactful without the group of musicians playing while the ship is sinking. Would the viewer fully understand Marinette falling in love with Adrien if you only hear the background noise of the busy streets of Paris.Finally, would the player have that sense of adventure while traveling through Hyrule in Zelda games.
            </p>
            <p> The simple answer is not they wouldnâ€™t. These themes enhance the viewer experience while also connecting to them to their respected scenes. Otherwise, these scenes would feel empty and not as impactful.  Replaying specific scenes without the music can cause the viewer to feel lost and having to rely on what if being animated or filmed. This is why music is important it is not only used to pass time but to inspire emotions in people. </p>
